He observes that it was Heads 3 times in a row.\n\nFor the fourth toss, he bets everything on Tails.\n\n**His Intuition:** \"It must be Tails now! Heads is 'tired'. The universe needs to balance it out.\"\n\n**The Reality:** The coin has no memory. The chance is still 50/50.\n\nWhen it lands on Heads again, he loses. He wasn't playing the odds; he was playing his emotions.\n\nStatistics protects us from this mistake. Evidence shows that the best move in a fair coin game is actually not to play, because in the long run, you only break even."

Your brain handles N=5 easily.\n\n**The Stadium:** Now imagine a stadium with 50,000 people. Can you estimate the average height by \"looking\"? Impossible. Your intuition crashes.\n\nStatistics is the tool that scales. It allows us to get the required info (Average Height, Happiness, Income) even in a stadium of millions."
