You failed because you are human.\n\nYour brain has a \"RAM limit.\" In 1956, cognitive psychologist George A. Miller published a famous paper proving that the average human working memory can only hold about 7 items (plus or minus two) at once.\n\nWhen you looked at that list of 1,000 scores, your brain tried to hold them all. Once you passed the 7th number, your brain had to \"overwrite\" the previous ones to make room.\n\nThis is why Statistics exists. It is not just \"math.\" It is a survival tool for your brain. It allows us to compress 1,000 items (which we can't handle) into 1 item (which we can). [[cit1]]",
